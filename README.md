# üßê Visual ontology exploration

You can use the browser tool [WebVOWL](https://github.com/VisualDataWeb/WebVOWL) order to visually explore the ontologies. The following links will open the current drafts for ontologies:

- [**A plant protection ontology for Swiss agriculture.**](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blw-ofag-ufag/ontology/refs/heads/main/ontology/plant-protection-ontology.ttl)
- [**Plant protection ontology with instance count.**](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blw-ofag-ufag/ontology/refs/heads/main/graph/plant-protection.ttl) (Might take a little longer to load.)

# üåê Demonstration sites

- [**What is an ontology and how can it help us?**](https://blw-ofag-ufag.github.io/ontology/presentation) An internal presentation to give some motivation to work on this project, first held on 12 December 2024.
- [**Clustering the many SRPPP obligations.**](https://blw-ofag-ufag.github.io/ontology/embeddings) A brief documentation of how the clustering of the Swiss registry of plant protection products (SRPPP) was performed using A.I.
- [**A crop table with alternative names:**](https://blw-ofag-ufag.github.io/ontology/crop-table) Alternative names are important for good user experiences in complex systems, because different people use differnt names for the same thing.

# üìÇ Repository structure

This repository is structured as follows:

1. `/ontology` contains turtle files of specific OWL ontologies.
2. `/data` contains turtle files with the actual data (following the aforementioned ontologies).
3. `/graph` contains the entire graph, i.e. the merged ontologies, shapes and data files. This is the content uploaded to LINDAS.
4. `/scripts` contains various scripts to write the data to graphs.
5. `/mapping-tables` contains various tables to map instances of classes to existing objects.
6. `/docs` contains a bunch of example html documents that are served as GitHub pages.
7. `/varia` various files.
8. `/deprecated` deprecated files.

# üÜô How to upload the turtle files to LINDAS

In order to upload a graph (as a turtle `.ttl` file) to the linked data service LINDAS, use the following cURL command:

```curl
curl \
  --user lindas-foag:mySuperStrongPassword \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: text/turtle" \
  --data-binary @graph/plant-protection.ttl \
  "https://stardog-test.cluster.ldbar.ch/lindas?graph=https://lindas.admin.ch/foag/ontologies"
```

Replace `mySuperStrongPassword` with the actual password. Of course, `graph/plant-protection.ttl` could be set to another turtle file and `https://lindas.admin.ch/foag/ontologies` to another target graph.

*If* data that was already uploaded was changed, clear the existing graph before posting. (Otherwise, stardog creates duplicate nodes for the changes.) To clear the graph, run:

```curl
curl \
  --user lindas-foag:mySuperStrongPassword \
  -X DELETE \
  "https://stardog-test.cluster.ldbar.ch/lindas?graph=https://lindas.admin.ch/foag/ontologies"
```
