## Visual ontology exploration

To (visually) inspect the example ontology, open [this link](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blw-ofag-ufag/ontology/refs/heads/main/plant-protection.ttl) to open it using WebVOWL. The service fetches the ontology directly from this repository (i.e., from the `plant-protection.ttl` file).
