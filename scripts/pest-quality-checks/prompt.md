Here is a JSON structure about a *thing* in the Swiss plant protection product registry.

```json
  {
    "srppp-id": 11264,
    "labels": {
      "de": ["Seitentriebhemmung"],
      "fr": ["Inhibition des pousses latérales "],
      "it": ["Inibizione dei germogli laterali"],
      "en": [null],
      "la": [null]
    },
    "wikidata-iri": [null],
    "polyphyletic": null,
    "type": null
  },
```

Your job is to clean the JSON structure.

1. Refine the existing translations for the non-latin languages.
  a. If there are multiple expressions, split them into multiple elements in the array. (E.g. `["Junikäfer, Junibummerl"]` becomes `["Junikäfer", "Junibummerl"]`.
  b. If there are latin names for any of the non-latin languages, remove them. (E.g. `["Ophiosphaerella herpotricha"]` in English becomes `[null]`.)
  c. Make sure the names follow the specified languages style and good practice. (E.g. `["septoriose du persil  "]` becomes `["Septoriose du persil"]`.)
2. Complete the translations for the non-latin languages.
  a. Find translations for missing names in non-latin languages. If no translations exist in the specified languages, leave it `[null]`.
  b. Think about the existing names. Are they complete?  Are there often-used names that are not specified at all? If so, add these according to the array-structure specified above.
3. Think about the statements `polyphyletic`, `type`.
  a. `polyphyletic` refers to a biological taxon that includes more than one species and is `true` if this is given, `false` if not and `null` if the question cannot be answered because the *thing* is not a biological group (e.g., "Desinfektion").
  b. `type` refers to the `type` of crop stressor. It can be `"biotic"` if it's a biotic crop stressor, `"abiotic"` if it's an abiotic stressor or `"nonstressor"` if the *thing* described is not a crop stressor at all.

Note: If you don't know an answer, you can *always* leave the entry `null`. If you think an entry is wrong, you can set it to `null`. However, you're not allowed to change 1. the ID, 2. the wikidata IRI, 3. the latin names.
